Steps of Solution, problem 1
                  Three sided polygon is known as Triangle. It has a base and an altitude(height).
                  Area of Triangle = ½(b × h) where b is base and h is height.
                      Algorithm
                      1. Define base and height
                      2. Apply in the formula.
                      3. Print the Area.

Steps of Solution, problem 2
                Converting degrees to radians
                radian = degree * (Pi / 180)

Steps of Solution, problem 3
    For any positive integer ‘n’, the factorial of n is the product of all the values from 1 to n. In mathematics factorial of n is     represented by n!. Factorial of 0 is 1.
              Approach 1: Iterative Method
                Declare a variable with a value of the number whose factorial you have to find.
                Declare a function factorial taking the value as a parameter.
                In the function definition, initialize variable ans to 1.
                Loop in the range of [2, n].
                Multiply ans by the value of i in each iteration.
                Return the value of ans.
or,
              Approach 2: Recursive Method
                Declare a variable with a value of the number whose factorial you have to find.
                Declare a recursive function factorial taking the value as a parameter.
                The function returns 1 if the value is 0 else the return calls the function for value – 1.
                After recursion is over the value returned is the factorial.
