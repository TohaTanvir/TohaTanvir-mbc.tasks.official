##Steps of Solution, problem 1
Three sided polygon is known as Triangle. It has a base and an altitude(height).
Area of Triangle = ½(b × h) where b is base and h is height.

                        Algorithm
                          1. Define base and height
                          2. Apply in the formula.
                          3. Print the Area.

##Steps of Solution, problem 2
                
                Converting degrees to radians
                
                radian = degree * (Pi / 180)

##Steps of Solution, problem 3
    
    For any positive integer ‘n’, the factorial of n is the product of all the values from 1 to n.
    In mathematics factorial of n is represented by n!. Factorial of 0 is 1.
             
              Approach 1: Iterative Method
                Declare a variable with a value of the number whose factorial you have to find.
                Declare a function factorial taking the value as a parameter.
                In the function definition, initialize variable ans to 1.
                Loop in the range of [2, n].
                Multiply ans by the value of i in each iteration.
                Return the value of ans.
or,
              
              Approach 2: Recursive Method
                Declare a variable with a value of the number whose factorial you have to find.
                Declare a recursive function factorial taking the value as a parameter.
                The function returns 1 if the value is 0 else the return calls the function for value – 1.
                After recursion is over the value returned is the factorial.

##Steps of Solution, problem 4

##Steps of Solution, problem 6
The rule for leap years in the Gregorian calendar is:

        Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400.

##Steps of Solution, problem 7
  There are various methods to remove duplicates in the array. As like :
  
      Using filter() Method
      Using set() Method
      Using reduce() Method
      Using indexOf() Method
      Using forEach() Method
      Using Underscore.js _.uniq() Function
